# Recursion #
It means solving a problem using the solution of smaller subproblems(smaller version of the same problem) or defining a problem in terms of itself.  
## Parts of a recursive algorithm ## 
### Base case ###
Base case is a terminating condition where a function in=mmediately return the result.  
This is the smallest version of the problem for which we already know the solution.  
### Recursive structure ###
It is an idea to design a solution of a problem via the solution of its smaller sub-problems.  
## Steps of problem-solving using recursion ##  
1. Define base case  
2. Define recursive structure  
3. Combine the base case and the recursive structure  
## Ideas to keep in mind while working with recursion ##  
1. Our code must cover all valid instances of smaller input sizes.  
2. We must have a correct base case that stops the recursion.  
3. We must have a correct recursive structure.
